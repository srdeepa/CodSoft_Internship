# CodSoft Internship Projects

Welcome to my CodSoft internship repository! During my time at CodSoft, I worked on several projects that helped me enhance my C++ programming skills. Below is a brief overview of the projects I've completed.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Number Guessing Game

**Description:**
A simple console-based number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.

**Key Features:**
- Random number generation.
- User input handling.
- Feedback on guess accuracy.
- Number of attempts tracking.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ -o number_guessing_game number_guessing_game.cpp`).
4. Run the executable (`./number_guessing_game`).

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**Description:**
A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns and win or draw the game.

**Key Features:**
- Game board representation.
- Player turn management.
- Win/Draw condition checking.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.cpp`).
4. Run the executable (`./tic_tac_toe`).

### Task 3: Library Management System

**Description:**
A simple library management system to manage books and users. Includes functionality for adding, removing, and searching for books.

**Key Features:**
- Book management (add, remove, search).
- User management.
- Basic data persistence.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ -o library_management_system library_management_system.cpp`).
4. Run the executable (`./library_management_system`).

## Key Takeaways

- **Improved Problem-Solving Skills:** Worked on real-world problems and developed efficient solutions.
- **Enhanced C++ Proficiency:** Gained hands-on experience with core C++ concepts and techniques.
- **Project Management:** Learned to organize and document code effectively.
